        <h1 className="s-h2">Plain answers to the questions you should ask</h1>

        <h2 className="s-h2">Where your data lives</h2>
        <p>
          Your calls, bookings and customer records are stored in a managed Postgres database in the United States,
          encrypted at rest, and reached only over TLS. Every record is tagged with your workspace and every query is
          scoped to it, so one customer's data cannot appear in another's dashboard.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">Who can see it</h2>
        <p>
          The people you invite. Accounts are created by invitation only; there is no public sign-up. Our support staff can
          open your workspace to help you, and when they do, your dashboard shows it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">The phone line</h2>
        <p>
          Voice runs on Retell, a telephony and speech provider. Every message it sends to us about a call is signed, and we
          refuse any that is not. Recordings and transcripts are kept for the period you choose, ninety days by default,
          then deleted.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">What the assistant is told</h2>
        <p>
          Only what it needs for the call: your hours, your service area, your technicians' first names, the customer's
          first name and the booking. It never sees payment details, and it never quotes prices.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">Recording disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          The opening line tells the caller the call may be recorded and that they are speaking with an assistant. The
          wording is per state, and you approve it in onboarding.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">Texts</h2>
        <p>
          Customers are only texted after they agree on the call, and every text carries the STOP instruction. Consent is
          recorded with the words that were said and the time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="s-h2">If you leave</h2>
        <p>
          Your number is forwarded back the same day, and your data is exported to you on request and deleted thirty days
          after the account closes.
        </p>
