# Shared code across the three products

The dental, HVAC and legal intake products are separate repos, deployments
and databases by decision (see PRODUCT_PLAN.md, section 13). Features that
are the same in all three are built once and copied, file for file, under
the same names. This file records what is shared and which version each
repo carries, so a fix made in one can be diffed into the others.

Product-specific by design: `lib/tenant-config.ts` (what onboarding collects), `lib/product.ts`, `lib/recordings.ts`, the copy inside `app/(site)/*/page.tsx`, `lib/config.ts`, `lib/tools.ts`, `lib/schema.ts`
(the vertical's tables), `retell/`, the dashboard panels, the seed.

When copying: bring the file over unchanged, then adapt the imports and the
few product words (the cookie name in `lib/auth.ts`, the table list in
`lib/schema.ts`), bump the version in the target repo's SHARED.md, and run
the smoke test.
